Exercise 4: Employee Management System


QUESTION:


Scenario: 
You are developing an employee management system for a company. Efficiently managing employee records is crucial.



o   Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.



ANSWER:


An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in memory locations. This means that all elements of an array are placed one after the other in memory, without any gaps.
Arrays are a fundamental data structure used in programming to manage collections of elements efficiently.

- Contiguous MEMORY allocation: Elements are stored sequentially. 
  
- Fixed size: The size of an array is determined at creation and cannot be changed dynamically.
   
- Base address: The memory address of the first element is called the base address. 
  
- Index: Each element is accessed using an index, which is an integer value starting from 0.
   
- Element size: The size of each element depends on the data type (e.g., integer, string, etc.). 

- Address of an element can be calculated using the following formula: 
[Address(A[i]) = Base Address(A) + i × Size of each element ]
 
ADVANTAGES OF ARRAYS:

- As mentioned, arrays allow direct access to any element using its index, which makes data retrieval very fast. This is particularly useful in an employee management system where quick access to employee records is necessary. 

-  Since arrays are of fixed size and occupy contiguous memory, it is easy to predict and manage memory usage. This predictability is crucial for system performance, especially when dealing with a large number of employee records.

- Arrays benefit from spatial locality of reference because elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. This means that when one element is accessed, nearby elements are likely to be accessed soon, which is efficient for CPU caching mechanisms.

- Iterating through arrays is straightforward and efficient due to their contiguous memory layout. This is useful for operations like updating records, sorting, or filtering.

- Arrays have low memory overhead because they do not require additional memory for pointers or links, unlike linked lists or other dynamic data structures.
